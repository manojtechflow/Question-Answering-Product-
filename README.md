# AI-Powered Insurance Document Inference and Knowledge Retrieval System

## Overview

This is an end-to-end Question & Answering (Q&A) Module. The module is an integral part of Natural Language Processing (NLP) systems, enabling computers to understand and respond to questions in human language. It involves various steps such as tokenization, model selection, contextual understanding, answer prediction, and response formatting.

The focus of this Q&A Module is to utilize pre-trained language models like BERT, GPT, etc., for comprehending context and providing accurate answers. The project distinguishes between closed-domain (specific domain) and open-domain (general knowledge) QA systems, highlighting their respective characteristics.

## Project Structure

### **Introduction to Question & Answer Module**
- **Intro**: The Q&A Module, an integral component of NLP systems, empowers computers to comprehend and respond to human language questions. It processes textual input, involving steps like tokenization, model selection, contextual understanding, answer prediction, and response formatting. By leveraging pre-trained language models such as BERT and GPT, the module efficiently understands context and generates accurate responses. Q&A systems can be categorized into closed-domain, specific to a certain domain, and open-domain, covering general knowledge.

### **Closed Domain VS Open Domain Q&A**

- **Objective**: Understand the differences between closed-domain and open-domain Q&A systems.
Closed-domain Q&A systems focus on specific topics, ensuring higher accuracy within their designated domain, often predefined for tasks like customer support. In contrast, open-domain Q&A systems cover a broad spectrum of topics and general knowledge, offering the ability to answer a wider range of questions. However, they may have lower accuracy due to the vast contextual diversity, making them suitable for general information queries and exploratory searches.
